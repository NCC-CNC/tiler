Title: Create Non-Geographic Map Tiles from an Image File
Description: Creates simple coordinate reference system (CRS) map tiles for non-geographic images. It uses an alternative version of 'gdal2tiles.py' to work with images like PNG files that are non-geographic, meaning they do not have an geospatial projection.
    These tiles can be used with the 'leaflet' package using the simple CRS Leaflet option.
